    desc: `The Vistana Signature Experiences mobile app** is designed to make planning, managing, and enjoying vacations seamless for travelers and owners alike. Users can browse destinations, explore resort amenities, and get inspired with vacation ideas, photos, and activities. The app provides access to upcoming reservations, resort details, and special offers, ensuring that members and guests stay informed and prepared for their trips. With a clean interface and imagery-driven design, the app balances inspiration with practical functionality.\n\nFor Vistana owners, the app extends further by offering access to ownership details such as benefit levels, StarOptions, and balances. Members can log in with their existing vistana.com credentials to view personalized dashboards, manage their profiles, and even share vacation photos, videos, and stories with the community. While some content is available without logging in, full functionality requires an account, making the app both a travel planning tool and an ownership companion that connects inspiration, management, and community in one platform.\n\n The project was originally designed with simple mockups and wireframes and then shipped off to an overseas development team. However, the overseas team needed more direction than mocks with generic text and images. That's where I came in. I took the initial wireframes and mockups and created a full design system with reusable components, a style guide, and a comprehensive page by page designs in photoshop and indesign. This ensured that the overseas developers had clear guidelines and assets to work with, leading to a more cohesive and efficient development process.`,

Its mission centers on accessibility and innovation, striving to create an environment where learners can thrive regardless of location. The product itself is built with modern web technologies that prioritize speed, reliability, and ease of use.\n\nWhen I joined the project, it was at risk of being shelved—after more than a year in development, the existing framework was failing to deliver results. As Project Lead and Lead Front-End Developer, I implemented a comprehensive project plan in Jira that brought clarity, accountability, and measurable progress. Simultaneously, I designed and developed a completely new front-end React framework to replace the faltering one, and within just seven months, transformed the project into a fully fledged virtual tutoring app—on time, on spec, and ready for users. \n\n Due to NDA agreements, I am unable to share the live site or codebase, but I can provide detailed insights into the technologies and methodologies used.",

As Project Lead and Lead Front-End Developer, I restructured the effort by introducing a project plan in Jira while keeping development moving forward simultaneously. I implemented a full front-end templating system in Vue.js with PHP as the backend, building reusable, scalable components for destination and hotel displays, booking flows, confirmations, and automated email notifications.

In undertaking the migration to the latest version of Drupal, you handled the *entire port*, ensuring that all content types, display logic, and site structure translated cleanly into the new system.
